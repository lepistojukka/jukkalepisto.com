## About implemention
- Update <meta> tags at head of index.html: Such as title, description, og-tags, url etc..
- Body of index.html itself is pretty self-explanatory and it constructs of numerous div-section with each having its own class (css class).
- I have user Material Design Icons: Please find them here in case you want to replace or add any: https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline
- If you update menu ( inside <header> tag ), remember to update element id's as well. For example link <a href="#experience" class="menu">Experience</a> takes user to element with id "experience"
