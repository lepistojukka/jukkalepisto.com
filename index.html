                <br>I'm an agile business designer from Helsinki, Finland. I help teams at startups and larger companies to succeed in rapidly changing business environment with help of lean principles, agile development and human insight.
                <br> They say a new hire is able to observe the processes, offering and interactions in a company from a view that hardly no one else can and ask to most challenging questions. Usually this advantage diminishes over time. But I've set myself a goal to maintain that skill every day.

                            How do you create great customer experiences? In most cases in IT projects sales is separated from delivery and you end up
                            delivering something else what was expected. That’s due to missing the hidden knowledge gained
                            in sales process.
                            <br> We decided to fix this.
                            <br> Each case is different. Each customer is different.
                            <br> The goal of this role is not simply to offer fancy solution and methods in a nice looking format.
                            Well yes, that’s done also. But rather me and my fellows make sure we deliver what we say we
                            deliver with methods we say we use. There’s no transition between sales and delivery. I kickoff
                            the project and make sure everyone in a team understands the customer value proposition and communication
                            is transparent. Later, once that is assured and project runs smoothly I jump off to next case
                            and repeat.
                            <br> This is how you make great customer experience!

                                This is tough post to perform well. And to perform well you need great people skills. In this task I have to solve extremely complex non trivial people related problems and act as trusted advisor. You know when you have excelled yourself when people in your tribe (i.e. team) grow in their career, they find purpose for the work and they come to ask help from you.
                                <br>
                                One of the main responsibilities of this role is to lead growth discussion twice a year. I took this a step further and we kind of ditched the formal growth discussion and started having personalised ongoing discussion. Each tribe member is different, they are individuals. They have unique skills, needs and problems, and my job is to listen and analyse what each member in my tribe wants to do for work, what they like, what they don’t like, how they work, what their values are, what their needs are and so on and so on. It’s kind of being an account manager, but for your people in your team.
                                <br>
                                Roughly this role is about 40% trust, 30% needs, 20% competence development and 10% salary.

                            I was asked to jump in to a challenging situation. Client satisfaction was low, overall atmosphere tense and project had already been rolling few months with not too many outcomes. 
                            <br>
                            First thing I noticed was the amazing skills of the team. Especially technical development skills. Seemed we just weren’t focusing on the right things. It was also amazing how clearly the challenges appeared for an outsider. We set a clear target, refined our roles and increased communication. I went a bit over a usual scrum master responsibilities - like everyone else with their own roles - but it paid off. Few months later we started receiving great feedback.

                                In this gig we set some sort of record - from scracth to production in 5 weeks. And this included difficult integrations and environment setup. Basically there wasn't a day lose. I had multi role of agile project lead and service design responsibility in addition to facilitationn of Scrum ceremonies. I don't prefer fixed fee, fixed scope, fixed schedule projects (although it is a definition of a project), but I must say they do set a great challenge to deliver everything in time and budget. So I guess I can call that a successful project.
